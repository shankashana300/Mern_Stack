It is necessary to execute npm install I in order to install the components before starting the frontend application. Then, "npm install" must be installed in order to load the packages into a specified folder in order to start the Create React App. 

On the backend, the same thing occurs, for instance after npm install. Additionally, it is necessary to install the aforementioned modules for the frontend and backend, such as node modules.
